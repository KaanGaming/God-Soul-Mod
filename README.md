# God-Soul-Mod
A mod which makes hollowknight way, way, way harder. Like any radiance hard. Good luck.

Notes:
1.When you first open up a save file the game will turn black, freeze for a few seconds and bring you back to the menu screen (you might see images or music of some scenes depending on the performance of your computer). This is normal. It's just my way of loading assets. (because I didn't know there was a in built way of doing that until it was to late). It will only happen on the first time of any play session
2. I'm not 100% certain but I'm pretty sure 112% is possible for this mod. Please tell me if you've done something but haven't gotten a percentage for it, or gotten too much percentage
3. This mod should be compatible with most other mods. I don't know why you'd want to make this even hard but you can
